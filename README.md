# AspNetCore-Vue-Typescript-Starter
Starter project template using AstNetCore + Vue + Typescript with Vuetify and Webpack

This is a proof of concept of AspNetCore 2.1 MVC to work with Vue in that is not a SPA. Its more like a hybrid mini spa per mvc page. It makes use of the Vue `<component inline-template is="">` tag to keep one foot on the server and one foot in javascript land. Routing is done with MVC Routing.
